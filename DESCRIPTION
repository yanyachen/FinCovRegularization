Description: Estimation and regularization for covariance matrix of asset
    returns. For covariance matrix estimation, three major types of factor
    models are included: macroeconomic factor model, fundamental factor model and
    statistical factor model. For covariance matrix regularization, four regularized
    estimators are included: banding, tapering, hard-thresholding and soft-
    thresholding. The tuning parameters of these regularized estimators are selected
    via cross-validation.
